            <h4>Hi, this is Murali Krishna Tulluri</h4>
            <div>
                <p>I have over 10 years of experience in the IT industry.
                    Most of it as a Data Engineer and a few years as a Data Analyst.
                    I have lived and worked in California for 6 years for companies Apple and Ebay. 
                </p>
                    <p>I wanted to gain knowledge in Statistics and Machine Learning and after researching for the best programs available in Canada
                        I found SMU's MScCDA course to be suitable for my needs and hence I chose to join this program.
                    </p>
